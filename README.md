# Challenge Three: Payroll Tracker

## Description

I was given starter code with the expectation of adding JavaScript functions and methods that make the webpage an interactive employee payroll tracker.  Through the added interactive aspects, a user can add multiple units of employee information including a First Name, Last Name, and Salary.  The information will not only be stored but then presented in a series of rows and columns.  On top of this, if a user opens the console browser they will be able to see prompts that show the average salary of all employees as well as selects a random employee for a raffle type drawing.

## Usage

When the live webpage is opened, user is presented with a simple payroll tracker.  When the user clicks on the "Add Employees" button they aare presented with a pop up window that allows them to add the first and last name of an employee as well as their salary in three separate prompts.  After those three values are put in, the user will be asked if they want to add another employee and given the option of Yes or Cancel.  For every time the user selects "Yes" they can add as many employee names and salaries as necessary.  Once they choose "Cancel" all of the employees will be displayed in a list.  The user can also use Dev Tools to find additional information, including the average salary of all employees that were put into prompts, as well as showing a random employee selected for a raffle type drawing.
